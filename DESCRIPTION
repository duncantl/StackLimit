Package: StackLimit
Version: 0.1-0
Title: Query and Set Stack Limit
Description:
 Note that R computes the stack when it starts. Resetting the stack
 won't change R's view of its size.
 Instead, use the shell command ulimit -s size before starting the R process.
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Note: There is probably an existing package with this in it.
